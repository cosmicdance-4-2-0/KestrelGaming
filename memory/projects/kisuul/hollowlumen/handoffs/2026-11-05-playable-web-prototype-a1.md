# First HollowLumen playable web prototype

## Summary

**Goal and acceptance criteria:** Implement a small web vertical slice from the README-only source, preserving main during development and testing economy/domain logic.

**Task outcome:** PARTIAL technically; **provisional gameplay acceptance** after user reported successful hands-on testing. GitHub confirms PR #1 is **merged**. Build, browser compatibility matrix, accessibility, security and original designer's visual approval are still not claimed.

**Authorized scope and boundaries (historical; recheck on resume):** The earlier user request authorized greenfield development and review flow. Historical authorization alone does not permit release, deployment, payment integration or destructive changes.

**Target repository, branch, and commit:** [Kisuul/hollowlumen](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen), first implementation branch `feat/playable-hollow-v0-1` at `917ca66cc811052898349f25de0d7c25255d70e6`; [PR #1](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen/pull/1) now merged; main at `4e2ade8a019f45bc39a6ea0d17b949eb4ced97b9`.

**Memory revision loaded:** KestrelGaming `d591d8ac2ad96ea20370d67cf8df010dac995a02` at initial work, this note supersedes stale PR-open status.

## Evidence

**Confirmed observations:** Initial main contained README only. PR #1 added 12 files covering React/Vite/TanStack Router/Zustand/Tailwind, five-tab UI, game state, SVG art, save validation and tests. PR #1 is merged. User reports the first version works as expected and gives provisional sign-off.

**Hypotheses and assumptions:** The user's functional acceptance is encouraging but does not replace targeted QA, security, or the original designer's aesthetic approval.

**Decisions:** Maintain semantic distinction between user acceptance, verified test results, actual GitHub merge, and pending validation. Do not overwrite the functional prototype simply to restyle it.

**Changed files and uncommitted state to preserve:** The 12 files from PR #1 are integrated on main. No new gameplay edits in the style guide task.

| Command or check actually performed | Observed result | Environment / limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node --test tests/*.test.js` | 9 passed, 0 failed | Initial authoring environment |
| TypeScript JSX parser | 3 files without syntax parse errors | Does not establish bundling correctness |
| Remote file content comparison | 12/12 matched intended source | Feature branch during PR #1 |
| GitHub `get_pr_info` on PR #1 | merged=true | Current repository state |
| User manual test report | Stage one worked; provisional sign-off | User-stated, no device matrix or trace |
| `npm install`, `npm run build` | Not verified by agent | Registry unavailable in initial environment |

**Persistence:** Prototype integrated to main; acceptance provisional; remaining QA tracked here.

## Next action

**Open risks:** No independent full build/browser accessibility and security verification recorded. Original designer's visual approval still outstanding.

**Next useful step:** Review the separate proposed [visual style guide PR #2](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen/pull/2), then implement in a separate code PR only after aesthetic review. Keep functionality stable.

## Revisit when

Main/PR state or requirements change, or newly run tests alter these observations.
