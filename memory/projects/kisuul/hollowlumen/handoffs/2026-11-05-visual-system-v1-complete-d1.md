# HollowLumen visual design system v1.0 — specification completion

## Summary

**Goal and acceptance criteria:** Conclude design-language work without changing playable prototype runtime: preserve approved day/night palettes, produce canonical semantic tokens, define interaction/lighting rules and acceptance tests.

**Task outcome:** COMPLETE **for design specification only**. Open design PR #2 is **ready for review** and not merged. No CSS/runtime changes, no planet/solar engine implemented.

**Authorized scope and boundaries (historical; recheck on resume):** User requested design-language completion after reporting that original designer approved day and night palette choices. This does not authorize design PR merge, release, native widgets, location tracking or gameplay rewrites.

**Target repository, branch, and commit:** [Kisuul/hollowlumen](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen), `design/pastel-twilight-craft-v0-1`, head `61211b88778239f92fe668d0614daba0688e3b24`, [PR #2](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen/pull/2) open, ready for review. `main` had `4e2ade8a019f45bc39a6ea0d17b949eb4ced97b9` at design work.

**Memory revision loaded:** KestrelGaming `bfda4efd156d5a182c4481bfe43d3d9c7b375b49`; previous day/night design memory on this PR's branch was archived rather than erased.

## Evidence

**Confirmed observations with sources:** User reports both palettes approved by original designer; original stage-one prototype functionality provisionally accepted. Design PR now comprises seven `docs/design/*` and `tools/validate-design-tokens.mjs` files. The canonical files are:
- [Visual Design System v1.0](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen/blob/design/pastel-twilight-craft-v0-1/docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM_v1.md)
- [DTCG 2025.10 color/semantic tokens](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen/blob/design/pastel-twilight-craft-v0-1/docs/design/tokens/visual.tokens.json)
- [Stage-two implementation acceptance](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen/blob/design/pastel-twilight-craft-v0-1/docs/design/IMPLEMENTATION_ACCEPTANCE.md)

**Decisions:** Two independent layers: world lighting and readable UI theme. Keep fictional 45°N solar-cycle recommendation as a proposed approximation (no GPS); do not present it as user's actual local sunrise. Add follow-world, light/dark overrides and temporary preview, none of which may alter economy state. Preserve existing game behavior.

**Changed files/uncommitted state:** PR #2 modifications only to seven new design/tooling files relative to `main`. Earlier Markdown literal-backtick escape issue corrected. No runtime styles, bundle scripts or source game logic changed.

| Check actually performed | Observed result | Environment / limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub compare main...design branch | 6 commits ahead, 0 behind; 7 new design/tooling files | No runtime edits |
| GitHub fetch of 7 files | All present, expected content | Connector read-back |
| Independent token resolver/contrast checks on fetched JSON | 78 tokens resolved, 22 semantic contrast pairs pass; lowest tested normal-text ratio 5.43:1 | Opaque solid colors only |
| Node `tools/validate-design-tokens.mjs` | **Not executed** | Checkout with Node required |
| Full browser/design visual review | **Not executed** | Future implementation stage |
| Kestrel `tools/validate_seed.py` | **Not executed** | Requires full checkout |

**Persistence:** Design work saved on HollowLumen feature branch and PR; Kestrel notes on this separate memory PR. Do not claim main integration until verified.

## Next action

**Open blockers and risks:** Solar-engine precision and device clock DST behavior are unimplemented; fonts need license and packaging decisions; accessibility checks require an actual rendered application. No user geography is collected in the proposed default.

**Next useful step:** User/maintainer reviews and merges documentation when appropriate. Start a separate implementation branch for theme-token mapping and the Home+Pip day/night preview; test pure solar model independently. Keep stage-one functionality protected and run full browser QA before expanding to all five screens.

## Revisit when

PR #2 changes, design assumptions are altered, or implementation starts. Refresh actual main, PR head, test results and memory head before acting.
