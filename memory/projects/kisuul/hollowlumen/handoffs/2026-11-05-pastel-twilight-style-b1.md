# Pastel Twilight Craft visual guide v0.1

**Historical task snapshot (archived):** This record describes the earlier draft before both palettes were approved. For the completed design specification and exact PR #2 revision, see [Visual System v1.0 handoff](2026-11-05-visual-system-v1-complete-d1.md). Prior observations below retain their original dates and evidentiary scope.

## Summary

**Goal and acceptance criteria:** Establish a compact, implementable lavender-led visual standard for Lumenette Hollow, with explicit semantic tokens, accessible text combinations, component language, materials, motion and approval criteria.

**Task outcome:** PARTIAL — [docs-only draft PR #2](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen/pull/2) now includes the original day guide and a separate night-cycle design note. The original designer approved the **earlier daylight visual reference** according to the user, but actual style-token implementation and the new night direction still need review. No application styling was changed.

**Authorized scope and boundaries (historical; recheck on resume):** User asked to proceed with mini style guide after stage-one provisional signoff; no automatic approval to merge or reskin.

**Target repository, branch, and commit:** [Kisuul/hollowlumen](https://github.com/Kisuul/hollowlumen), `design/pastel-twilight-craft-v0-1`, `ec201b71281e993026d3c463c41267eda80b159f`; `docs/design/STYLE_GUIDE_v0.1.md` plus `docs/design/NIGHT_MODE_v0.1.md`; draft PR #2.

**Memory revision loaded:** Kestrel project profile and earlier stage-one handoff on the existing memory work branch, revised in this same task.

## Evidence

**Confirmed observations with sources:** User states designer prefers purple and pastels. Existing prototype CSS uses mostly sage/cream. Proposed design tokens and documented contrast tests were authored independently of production UI.

**Hypotheses and assumptions:** The daylight visual reference was approved (user-reported), but exact hex values, the fonts Quicksand/Nunito Sans, dark-mode treatment and implementation details are still subject to review.

**Decisions and rationale:** Use Plum Jam `#6F548F` + white for solid buttons (calculated 6.29:1); Midnight Thread `#3B2E44` on Lavender Bloom `#B79CFF` (5.55:1), since white on Lavender Bloom is only 2.28:1. Purple anchors the system, softer surfaces support it. Avoid intrusive motion and pressure tactics.

**Changed files and uncommitted state to preserve:** PR #2 changes exactly two markdown design guides; no gameplay or CSS changes. Night-mode work is described in the [separate handoff](2026-11-05-moonlit-lavender-cycle-c1.md).

| Command or check actually performed | Observed result | Environment / limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub compare main...design branch | 1 commit ahead, 1 markdown file added | No code changes |
| GitHub fetch of committed guide | Guide present with expected sections and palette | Source check, not UI QA |
| WCAG luminance ratio calculation for named pairs | Contrasts as recorded in guide | Solid RGB swatches only; rendered states not audited |

**Persistence:** Proposal saved on branch and linked in draft PR, **not integrated**.

## Next action

**Open blockers or risks:** Designer approves the daylight **reference**, not necessarily exact tokens and the new night proposal. Implementation requires rendered contrast, keyboard and mobile tests.

**Next useful step:** Review and approve the Moonlit Lavender proposal, then apply shared day/night tokens in a distinct implementation branch starting with Home and Pip. Respect stage-one functional acceptance.

## Revisit when

PR #2 is revised, new visual references are provided, or design implementation changes assumptions.
