# Auralprinter A1 representation checkpoint

## Summary

**Goal and acceptance criteria:** Establish exact language-neutral scalar interchange through a small Rust/Python experiment, tests, and documented rationale, before source schemas or DSP.

**Task outcome:** PARTIAL

The full A1 milestone remains incomplete; AP-A1-01a is COMPLETE and merged.

Pass 1's standalone Rust/Python representation experiment is **merged** in Auralprinter `main`. The encoding decision in ADR-011 remains an independently reviewable proposal, not an adopted production API; A1 as a whole remains incomplete. This checkpoint status was reconciled on 2026-11-05 by ChatGPT.

**Target:** [Auralprinter PR #2](https://github.com/cosmicdance-4-2-0/Auralprinter/pull/2), **merged** on 2026-11-05T07:19:02Z into `main` at `2e3372875415cc21e9c91ef84da06e04fe4e57f9`. Historical implementation branch: `feat/a1-representation-proof`, head `0a891f3c75524ad65e85412a9880a4a1eba13a80`. Recheck the latest main before any new work.

**Historical scope:** This checkpoint covers representation only. Source/block/epoch schemas, application DSP, realtime devices, and visualizers remain future work. Current authorization must be checked independently on resume.

## Evidence

- The earlier tested head `d5565ee4be2fa51cb41b641754b71be2ccfdecb0` passed [CI run 41985345424](https://github.com/cosmicdance-4-2-0/Auralprinter/actions/runs/41985345424) with 501 checks. **Post-merge `main` also passed** [CI run 41986376215](https://github.com/cosmicdance-4-2-0/Auralprinter/actions/runs/41986376215) at `2e3372875415cc21e9c91ef84da06e04fe4e57f9`: 501 checks, Rust build, Clippy and formatting. This is representation interoperability evidence only, not DSP accuracy or instrument conformance.
- [The project evidence](https://github.com/cosmicdance-4-2-0/Auralprinter/blob/0a891f3c75524ad65e85412a9880a4a1eba13a80/docs/PASS1_EVIDENCE.md) identifies the environment and claims supported by the results. Local Python-only checks were partial; the Rust checks ran in hosted CI.
- The proposed [representation decision](https://github.com/cosmicdance-4-2-0/Auralprinter/blob/0a891f3c75524ad65e85412a9880a4a1eba13a80/docs/REPRESENTATION_DECISION.md) records the rationale and limits. Both readers were authored in the same pass; cross-language agreement is not independent mathematical verification.
- **User-stated:** Preserve transparency, modularity, abstraction, visible features, and documentation of what and why. These directions are recorded in the PR's agent instructions and architecture.

**Persistence:** The application experiment is integrated in Auralprinter `main` at the merge commit above. This memory record resides in KestrelGaming; edits to it become part of Kestrel's shared `main` only after the memory reconciliation PR is merged. Its current destination should be checked when resuming.

## Next action

Continue with bounded **AP-A1-01b** source/block/epoch and channel/continuity contract work after reviewing ADR-011's representation assumptions. Preserve exact sample indices, rational rates, gap-versus-silence semantics and explicit schema compatibility choices. Do not treat PR #2's merge as ratification of production representation or as completion of A1; do not start DSP, device integration, or visualization in this pass.

## Revisit when

Resuming the project, when A1 schema work or the encoding decision changes, or if the user changes scope.
